Hi folks,

I've made a number of changes to the model:

1. Innovation premium and cost v gas:
    Innovation premium ignores Negawatts, while the cost v gas includes them, and because they're so cheap this figure then comes out negative.
    In our discussion we thought innovation premium was the more useful figure.

2. Footnotes/sources:
    The model now accepts technology data with or without footnotes.
    You can make the list of notes as long as you want and can include general notes that don't correspond to specific data points.
    Notes are displayed on the Inputs and Sources section on a scenario results page.

3. Prices in CSV upload:
    I've removed the field for prices (wholesale and gas) so they can also be added in the CSV file.
    Or if you don't add this in the CSV upload it will default to the new wholesale prices (BEIS 2017) and the gas prices calculated in the Excel model.

4. Ironing out another excel quirk:
    The Excel model was calculating the number of projects available in a way that misconstrued the price distribution of projects and also meant that all unsuccessful projects could continually bid into future rounds.
    The main reason this was problematic was that it meant the cap on how much capacity could be deployed in a year was being ignored.
    But I realised that for some technologies this is actually useful/realistic, especially if they have separate negotiations (ie nuclear), which could be unsuccessful for several years and yet still considered in future years.
    So there's now an option to turn this quirk completely off or on, or have it on just for separate negotiations.

5. Separate out quirks:
      At Chaitanya's suggestion, I've separated the Excel quirks out so you can select them individually.
      I've set the default to include only the one that allows projects in separate negotiations to be considered in future years.

6. Interpolation:
    It's now possible to add a csv file with missing technology values and the model will fill them in. It's still necessary for 2020 and 2030 values to be included.
    If intermediate values are included they will be used too.
    eg
    2020     0
    2030    10

    will produce
    2020     0
    2021     1
    2022     2
    2023     3
    2024     4
    2025     5
    2026     6
    2027     7
    2028     8
    2029     9
    2030    10

    while
    2020     0
    2022     9
    2030    10

    will produce
    2020     0
    2021     4.5
    2022     9
    2023     9.125
    2024     9.25
    2025     9.375
    2026     9.5
    2027     9.625
    2028     9.75
    2029     9.875
    2030    10


    It doesn't make a difference to the model whether years with no values still listed in the csv file or not.

7. Policies:
    Based on our discussion, I've created the option to allow polices to subtract costs off technologies rather than multiply a discount.
    I've also removed the ability of a policy to have any effect on exogenous things like wholesale and gas prices.

8. Error messages:
    I've added a bunch of error messages at various points that will (hopefully) be more helpful than the ones generated by Django.

9. Glossary:
    I've added a glossary of helpful terms and updated the instructions.


Things I haven't done that may be useful:
1. Added notes/sources to policies.
    You can add notes in the description of the policy but not for each data point like you can in the technology csv upload.
2. Properly tested the ability to turn technologies on and off or individual years.
    It seems to work so long as the 'allow previously unsuccessful projects for all technologies to be considered in future years' quirk is OFF, but I haven't tested it properly so don't KNOW KNOW that it's reliable.
3. Added support for inflation adjustment.
    The Excel version allows you to specify which year prices you'd like your results in and I haven't done this yet.
4. Reintroduced the 'Save as' feature that allows you to create new scenarios based off existing one. Could do this in two ways:
    Easy version: would still require a csv upload of the technology data but would save all the other settings for you, budget, quirks, policies, etc.
    Slightly harder version: would allow you to edit the inputs table directly, so you could alter individual values (obviously only useful if you wanted to alter one or two).
5. Made any attempt to calculate our own strike prices.
    Code wise this isn't too difficult, but calculation wise it probably is,
6. Created the ability to compare two or three scenarios side by side (overlaying graphs etc.)
    Probably unnecessary as you could just open in separate tabs.
    One thing I could do is make the graphs all have the same max on their vertical axis so they can at least be compared side by side. I tried to do this already and couldn't get it to work, but I could persevere.
7. Put pivot table summaries in the CSV download


I'd be happy to do these, or make any other changes that may be helpful, but I've now finshed my modelling days so would need to take it out of my remaining 7.5 days that are meant to be on other work. (or extend contract beyond 30 days).

And if you see any inexplicable errors or anything that obviously doesn't work, let me know and I'll fix it!

Let's get cracking on part 2! Be good to have a skype call soon. When is good for you Chaitanya?
