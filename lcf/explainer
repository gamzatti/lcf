Hi folks,

I've made a number of changes to the model:

1. Innovation premium and Cost v gas:
    Innovation premium ignores Negawatts, while the cost v gas includes them, and because they're so cheap this figure then comes out negative.
    In our discussion we thought innovation premium was the more useful figure.
    nb I get £219m in my scenario that matches Excel sc3 most closely, rather than £150m. This is to do with a couple of Excel quirks altering the actual amount of generation which I'm happy to explain on skype if you like.


2. Notes/sources:
    The model now accepts technology data with notes/sources as well as without.
    I've sort of followed the Excel layout, so there is a column with a number next to each data point, and then a description below of what the number corresponds to in terms of notes, source, link, local link.
