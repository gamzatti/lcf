python logic:
  *figure out why my answers don't match up!!
     - realised that solar PV (and possibly others?) are affected by the previous years. Because there are projects already funded at the lowest levelised costs, these ones aren't eligible in eg 2022
     I can't realllly be bothered to try and replicate this error in python. But it does point back to the problem in general with how it calculates costs including previously funded projects.
     - but what is going on with Wave, TS and TL? :(
  *figure out separate negotiations and negawatts
  *include comparison to gas prices: where does this enter in? presumably not in the actual auction process, just in the cost tally?
  ability to turn off technologies
  think about post 2026


initial data:
  *load in data for existing scenarios (1, 2 and 3) / write code that converts csv to either json or probably more easily to Django model

inputs:
  improve interface, eg  hide technology inputs initially with jquery, disallow editing of year and technology. ability to turn off technologies, maybe add choice options for prices? http://www.yergler.net/blog/2009/09/27/nested-formsets-with-django/ http://www.yergler.net/blog/2013/09/03/nested-formsets-redux/
  deal with tidal that has initial generation rather than capacity (for form?)
  errors for form fields being empty/incorrect?

tests:
  improve views tests
  test new scenario methods

appearance:
  write some CSS/use bootstrap components

output page:
  give option to display inputs with jquery
  output all the rest of the data to CSV

diverge from Excel model:
  ?create normal distribution of projects?
  maxima/minima?
  change the way each year is based on cumulative generation with the cost distribution therefore including previously funded projects
  create policy model
  various other things we talked about

speed up!/refactor:
  review lru_cache and consider initialising instance variables and then doing lazy calculation. and find out how to clear cache? (or at least do this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2237624/applying-python-decorators-to-methods-in-a-class)
  simplify model code eg by making template tags? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28513528/passing-arguments-to-model-methods-in-django-templates
  add javascript to delete buttons
  generally refactor according to better OOD and pandas
  clean up the different generation, capacity and money units
  deal with error message: a value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame


Finally feeling more alive so would like to have some actual goals for today.
It would be great if I could do top three things...
Maybe ambitious though!
It would also be great though if I could get back at a reasonable hour, eat a healthy dinner with Jon, get dressed up in plenty of time, and get to the party reasonably earlyish.
