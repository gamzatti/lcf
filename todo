extend python logic to do full calculations:
  create architecture which takes lump sum and distributes money between years and into pots and carries over previous underspend. is money ever reallocated between pots? or just over years?
  split into pots/separate negotiations/figure out where negawatts fit into all of this
  deal with unaffordable projects (diverge from Angela?)
  include comparison to gas prices
  adjust rank order (diverge from Angela? discuss with Dustin?)
  write tests
  improve performance!!


  ?create normal distribution of projects?

inputs:
  improve interface, eg with longer fields accepting series of values, hide technology inputs initially with jquery, disallow editing of year and technology. use nested forms? maybe add choice options for prices?
  make wholesale price adjustable
  make it so you can alter an existing scenario rather than the default
  make assumptions adjustable?
    normal/even distribution
    rank order problem above

output page:
  improve summary data (maybe display in table)
  hide inputs with jquery
  add graphs/visualisations
  create csv output option
