priority:
  *ability to turn off technologies (and pots) / check that swapping pots works as expected - eg separate negotiations for tidal (and putting nuclear in emerging?)
  *improve layout. create more tables and graphs inc. summary of pots (in dataframe?)
  *some proper refactoring!
  *upload to github/python anywhere (or heroku)

additional functionality:
  *think about post 2026. create option to have two auction periods?
  *create options to get rid of 89 extra being carried over, and for cumulative generation to start from 2021 not 2020 / combine all excel quirks into one checkbox
  *make it allow manual numbers of projects for TL and maybe manual amount of NW
  include absolute cost (ie not compared to wholesale price or gas price)
  option to switch between sets of prices?
  make a new model that groups together preferences

output page:
  give option to display inputs with jquery

initial data:
  *load in data for existing scenarios (1, 2 and 3) / write code that converts csv to either json or probably more easily to Django model

inputs:
  improve interface, eg  hide technology inputs initially with jquery, disallow editing of year and technology. ability to turn off technologies, maybe add choice options for prices? http://www.yergler.net/blog/2009/09/27/nested-formsets-with-django/ http://www.yergler.net/blog/2013/09/03/nested-formsets-redux/
  deal with tidal that has initial generation rather than capacity (for form?)
  errors for form fields being empty/incorrect?
  change form to not use 2020 input
  change form to not make name editable

tests:
  improve views tests
  test new scenario methods

appearance:
  write some CSS/use bootstrap components



diverge from Excel model:
  ?create normal distribution of projects?
  maxima/minima?
  change the way each year is based on cumulative generation with the cost distribution therefore including previously funded projects

speed up!/refactor:
  review lru_cache and consider initialising instance variables and then doing lazy calculation. and find out how to clear cache? (or at least do this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2237624/applying-python-decorators-to-methods-in-a-class)
  add javascript to delete buttons
  generally refactor according to better OOD and pandas
  clean up the different generation, capacity and money units
  deal with error message: a value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame

Resolved issues:
  * realised that solar PV was affected by the previous years. Because there are projects already funded at the lowest levelised costs, these ones aren't eligible in eg 2022. the way I've fixed this for now is just putting 0 for all years up to but not including 2020 in the number of projects in Excel version

Unresolved issues:
  * tidal is still funny because of the levelised cost being manually inputted for projects. Means I can't always match the answers. I've added a scenario option to sort of account for this, though it's only for the case of max_levelised cost = 150.
  * there seems to be a weird quirk that Â£89m extra is carried over each year than ought to be, because NW is counted in initial budget, but then 'unspent' is calculated by subtracting only the auction and negotiation spend from the initial budget
  * there's also a problem with trying to keep the generation constant while changing reference to gas prices, because you might think that cumulative generation is the same but if some of the distribution has shifted into 2020 then what you're paying for after that will be different.
